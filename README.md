# FINAL-PROJECT-WORK
# Flask MongoDB Data Collection App

## Project Overview

This project is a Flask web application designed to collect user data, store it in MongoDB, process the data, and visualize it in a Jupyter notebook. The application is deployed on AWS.

## Features

- Collect user data (age, gender, income, expenses)
- Store data in MongoDB
- Process and export data to CSV
- Generate visualizations for age-income relationships and gender-spending distribution
- Deployed on AWS for easy access

## Explanation of Visualization
- The first visualization, a bar plot of ages versus income, reveals which age groups have the highest earning potential. By analyzing this, we can pinpoint the life stages associated with peak financial stability, offering valuable information for financial planning and targeted marketing strategies.

- The second visualization, a box plot showing gender distribution across various spending categories, compares how different genders allocate their income. This analysis highlights the differences or similarities in spending habits between males and females across categories such as utilities, entertainment, school fees, shopping, and healthcare. Understanding these patterns is essential for businesses and policymakers, enabling them to tailor their strategies to meet the needs and preferences of different demographic groups.
